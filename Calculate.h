* Calculate.h
*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Most of the Razor's measurements are interpreted and calculated in this
* code. Readings are updated in Capture_Sample() once a second, and runs
* in the context of a priority 15 SWI. However the pulse count corresponding
* to oscillator frequency is measured by Count_Freq_Pulses().
* Count_Freq_Pulses() is called twice per second by the Timer module,
* so the code is run in the context of a HWI (a real-time constraint in
* measuring high frequencies). We read in the number of pulses counted by
* the counter of hardware timer 1 and divide by the sample period of 500ms
* (and multiply back the 80x frequency divider) to arrive at our oscillator
* frequency. This frequency, along with many other values and measurements,
* is used to calculate the watercut.
